House-museum of Hamo Sahyan

The house-museum of the poet Hamo Sahyan, located in Lor, Syunik marz, was opened on April 14, 2016, the poet's birthday. Hamo Sahyan's son, Nairi Sahyan, president of the "Hamo Sahyan Poetry Center" Public Organization, put his father's unusual archive up for sale in December in order to erect a statue of Hamo Sahyan and open his museum. But after the uproar of selling the poet's archive, the Ministry of Culture responded and quickly processed the issue of museum renovation.
There is his desk, on which he worked for more than 10 years, clocks, photos, books that he received as a gift.
A bust of Hamo Sahyan was erected in the courtyard of the house-museum.
