Sevanavank

Known as the "blue pearl of Armenia,"
Lake Sevan is a beauty from any sight. But wait until you see the amazing view from the hilltop when you reach Sevanavank (Sevan Monastery)! 
Located atop the peninsula, the Sevanavank medieval monastery is made up of two churches; The Church of Saint Arakelots (Holy Apostles) should be the first one you see. Take a walk around the complex to find the second larger church of Saint Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God).
Dating as far back as the gin century, this beautiful monastery was founded by Princess Mariam, daughter of Bagratuni King, Ashot the Great. Legend has it that after the unexpected death of her husband Prince Vasak of Syunik, Princess Mariam vowed to build churches in his memory.
She had a vision of Christ's 12 Apostles flying over Lake Sevan and marking the places where the churches should be built.
The complex originally consisted of two other churches, Saint Karapet and Saint Harutyun, believed to have been constructed by Saint Gregory the Illuminator in the 4 century. Today, only ruins remain of these original ancient churches.
Surrounding the complex is an extensive collection of khatchkars (Armenian cross-stones). These beautiful cross-stones demonstrate the different periods of the monastery's rich history and the wealth of artistic traditions in Armenia.
