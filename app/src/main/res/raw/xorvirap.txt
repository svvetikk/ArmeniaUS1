Khor Virap

There are two churches here at Khor Virap:
St. Gevorg Chapel and the larger St.
Astvatsatsin Church, which was built much later in the 17th century. Walk into St.
Gevorg Chapel and you are at the very spot where St. Gregory was sent into imprisonment. Climb down the ladder (hold on tight!) and look around when you reach the bottom. See the light above? That's where St. Gregory received his food.
