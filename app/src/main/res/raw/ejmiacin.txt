Holy Etchmiadzin

The Cathedral of Holy Etchmiadzin is considered the heart and soul of the Armenian nation. It has stood as a symbol of the Armenian faith for over 1,700 years.
Etchmiadzin Cathedral
Holy Etchmiadzin is the oldest Christian cathedral in the world. According to tradition, soon after King Trdat III declared
Christianity as the state religion of Armenia, St. Gregory the Illuminator had a divine vision of Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, descending from heaven and striking the ground with a golden hammer to mark the place where the cathedral should be built. And so, the cathedral was built on that very spot from
301-303 A.D. In Armenian, the name Etchmiadzin means "Descent of the Only Begotten," and as such is the perfect name for this cathedral.
This is where the hammer struck. Years ago, archeologists found a fire pit beneath this spot and believe that the cathedral replaced a pagan temple where Armenians traditionally worshipped fire before they adopted Christianity.
This, the holiest of Armenian cathedrals, is a good place for reflection.
