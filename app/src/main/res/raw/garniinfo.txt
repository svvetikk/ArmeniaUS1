Temple of Garni

Believe it or not, ancient history stands right in front of you!
If you've seen pictures of ancient Rome or Greece, this might look familiar. Or maybe you've visited Athens, Greece or Baalbek, Lebanon and noticed similar temples? This is because they were all built by ancient civilizations.
Paganism in Armenia
Long before Christianity and the Armenian state, Armenia was called Urartu, which means "Kingdom of Ararat." At this time, Armenians, like the Greeks and Romans, believed in many gods-not just one. They worshipped gods of nature and believed in mythological creatures and heroes. This religion is called paganism, and at the time many temples were constructed to honor pagan gods. The Temple of Garni was built in the first century and was dedicated to the sun god, Mihr. Armenians worshipped these gods for hundreds of years.
In 301 A.D., as King Trdat III became cured of his illness by St. Gregory the Illuminator, he converted to Christianity. He declared Urartu a Christian nation, forbade the worship of other gods, and abolished paganism. All pagan temples were to be destroyed. The only one that remains to this day is the Temple of Garni.
