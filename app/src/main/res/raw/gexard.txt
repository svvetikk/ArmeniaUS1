Geghard Monastery

Walk up the steep hill past the vendors selling sweet sujukh and gata to find a true wonder in the middle of the Azat Valley.
Take a picture as you pass under the archway-it looks like the church is built next to the mountain but get closer and you'll see that it's carved into the rock!
Geghard is actually a medieval monastery complex made up of many unique chapels and chambers. It was founded by St.
Gregory the Illuminator in the fourth century but most of what you see today was built in the 13th century and the years that followed. The main cathedral (Katoghike) of Surp Astvatsatsin was built in 1215 A.D. It has a domed ceiling with a round skylight in the middle that lets the most beautiful light shine through here throughout the day.
